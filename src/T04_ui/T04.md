# Why?

- Good-looking + good-UX design takes a lots of work.
- We want to
  - Spend more time on business logic, not UI design and UI logic.
  - Establish common framework for collaboration.
  - Have maintainable and extensible system.

# Consideration

- Ease of use
  - How much code do I need to write?
- Customizability
  - How much can I change down the line?
- Inclusiveness
  - Do I need to install extra things?
- Look and feel
  - Does it make my app look generic?

# Disclaimer

- The choices of UI libraries can be opionated.
- At the end of the day, you must choose your own path.
- Anything marked with 🦀 is my opinion. You don't have to take it.

---

# "Style" lirary

---

---

# Styled Component

> Styling your way with speed, strong typing, and flexibility.

- Styled components are a CSS-in-JS tool that bridges the gap between components and styling.

- Installation note
  - For NextJS, follow the [instructions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components).

---

# Styled Component

- Good
  - CSS-in-JS
  - Full customizability from pure CSS
- Bad
  - 🦀 CSS-in-JS in separate file (anyway)
  - 🦀 Hard to maintain.

---

# Tailwind CSS

> Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML

- A utility-first CSS framework
  - Provides several of opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup.
- Come with NextJS.

---

# Tailwind CSS

- Good
  - Styling in markup
  - 🦀 Less customizability than pure CSS
  - 🦀 Maintainable: _(3 months from now, I can come back and quickly adjust style.)_
- Bad
  - Need to learn syntax
  - Ugly markup
    - Fix: Use VSCode extension or wrap markup in components.

---

# "Component" lirary

- `Bootstrap: React`
- `Mantine`
- Others
  - `Material UI`
  - `Ant Design`

---

# Bootstrap

- Good
  - Lots of premade components
  - Provided CSS bootrap class

  - 🦀 Bootstrap classes are verbose.
  - 🦀 Look "Bootstrap"
